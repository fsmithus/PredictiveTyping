# PredictiveTyping
Capstone Project for Coursera (Johns Hopkins) Data Science Certification

The project is to design and build a predictive typing web application. [Large datasets](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip) representative of blogs, news, and Twitter feeds have been provided. The application will accept free-form text, a keystroke at a time, and attempt to complete the current word-in-progress, or guess the next word that the writer intends.
